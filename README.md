# MetaClean
[Under Construction] CLI tool for effectively cleaning of a metadata in essentialy every file type 


All in all I guess it takes me a while to complete this project (currently working on my bachelor thesis), but I created this repo, so I wouldn't forget


##### Currently supported file types:
* None, since the core isn't finished yet

##### Coming up features:
* Choose what data should be removed
* Specify own file types (needs specification about where the metadata is and how large)
* Maybe ports (with UI) for Win/MacOS/Linux
